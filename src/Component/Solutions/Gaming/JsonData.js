        answer:
          "Absolutely. SMS provides a quick and secure way to send account recovery codes or troubleshooting steps to players. With two-factor authentication (2FA), players can receive a unique one-time password (OTP) directly to their registered phone number, adding an extra layer of security to their accounts. This ensures that sensitive account details remain protected, even in the case of unauthorized access attempts. Additionally, SMS offers a reliable way to assist players in real-time, making it an essential tool for customer support and security in the gaming industry."
